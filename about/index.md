This will be the 10th Summer School on Computational Interaction. This is a series which we started in Glasgow in 2015, and which has been run successfully at a range of venues.

Because of this success, we are expanding from the pure Summer School format to also include a 4 day long academic Symposium. We anticipate about 30 students and 40 academics and invited speakers to attend. 
There will also be two workshops. 

The student submission form will ask you to submit a CV, and a short research statement (no longer than 1 page) describing your research interests and a brief description of how attending this summer school will help you in your research. The deadline for applications is March 14, 2025 anywhere on Earth. Note that submitting an application is a binding registration, and upon acceptance you will need to pay the registration fee. 

*Computational interaction* often involves elements from machine learning, signal processing, information theory, optimisation, inference, control theory and formal modelling. Computational interaction would typically involve at least one of:
1. an explicit mathematical model of user-system behaviour;
2.  a way of updating that model with observed data from users;
3.  an algorithmic element that, using this model, can directly synthesise or adapt the design;
4.  a way of automating and instrumenting the modelling and design process;
5.  the ability to simulate or synthesise elements of the expected user-system behaviour.”
