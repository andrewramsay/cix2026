This will be the 10th Summer School on Computational Interaction. This is a series which we started in Glasgow in 2015, and which has been run successfully at a range of venues.

Because of this success, we are expanding from the pure Summer School format to also include a 4 day long academic Symposium. We anticipate about 30 students and 40 academics and invited speakers to attend. 
There will also be two workshops. 

*Computational interaction* often involves elements from machine learning, signal processing, information theory, optimisation, inference, control theory and formal modelling. Computational interaction would typically involve at least one of:
1. an explicit mathematical model of user-system behaviour;
2.  a way of updating that model with observed data from users;
3.  an algorithmic element that, using this model, can directly synthesise or adapt the design;
4.  a way of automating and instrumenting the modelling and design process;
5.  the ability to simulate or synthesise elements of the expected user-system behaviour.”
