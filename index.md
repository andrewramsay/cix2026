Welcome to the Symposium and Summer School on Computational Interaction! This year we are expanding from a Summer School format to also include a 4 day long academic Symposium. We anticipate about 30 students and 40 academics and invited speakers to attend. There will also be three Workshops.

*Computational interaction* often involves elements from machine learning, signal processing, information theory, optimisation, inference, control theory and formal modelling. Computational interaction would typically involve at least one of:

1. an explicit mathematical model of user-system behaviour;
2. a way of updating that model with observed data from users;
3. an algorithmic element that, using this model, can directly synthesise or adapt the design;
4. a way of automating and instrumenting the modelling and design process;
5. the ability to simulate or synthesise elements of the expected user-system behaviour.”
