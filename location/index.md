# Getting to Glasgow

## Air

There are 3 airports relatively close to Glasgow:

1. [Glasgow Airport](https://www.glasgowairport.com/): the closest airport to the city. Travel to/from the airport is best done by [bus](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/greater-glasgow/routes-and-maps/glasgow-airport-express) or taxi (there are no rail services).
2. [Edinburgh Airport](https://www.edinburghairport.com/): around 40 miles from Glasgow, but is a busier airport and may have more flight options. From the airport, you can reach Glasgow by [bus](https://www.citylink.co.uk/timetables-service-updates/glasgow-edinburgh-airport/) or by train. If travelling by train, you can catch [a tram](https://edinburghtrams.com/) from just outside the airport terminal to the "Edinburgh Park Station" stop, co-located with the rail station of the same name. From here you can get a direct train to Glasgow.
3. [Prestwick Airport](https://www.glasgowprestwick.com/): around 30 miles from Glasgow, but has a limited range of flights. There is a train station adjacent to the airport with direct trains to Glasgow. A [bus](https://www.stagecoachbus.com/routes/west-scotland/X77K/ayr-glasgow/XTAX077K.O) service is also available. 

## Train

If you are travelling from England/Wales, long distance trains on the West Coast Main Line typically terminate at Glasgow Central Station in the city centre. If coming from further north in Scotland, look for services terminatingat the nearby Glasgow Queen Street instead. 

## Bus

The main bus terminus in the city is the [Buchanan Bus Station](https://www.spt.co.uk/travel-with-spt/bus/bus-stations-travel-information/bus-stations/buchanan-bus-station-glasgow/). Most intercity services to Glasgow will terminate here. 

## Car

The major roads leading into Glasgow are the M77, M74, and M8 motorways, approaching from the south, south-east, and east respectively. If you are driving up from the south of the UK, following the M74 is the most straightforward and direct route to take. 

# Getting to the University

The main Gilmorehill campus of the University of Glasgow is located in the West End of the city, a couple of miles from the city centre. 

The building where the events will be taking place is the **Sir Alwyn Williams Building**, located at **18 Lilybank Gardens, G12 8RZ** ([Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Sir+Alwyn+Williams+Building,+18+Lilybank+Gardens,+Glasgow+G12+8RZ/@55.8739304,-4.2943533,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x488845ce6db26041:0x9799e6ea5573567a!8m2!3d55.8739274!4d-4.291773!16s%2Fg%2F11fd4cc8kh?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)).

## Train

The closest train station to the university is [Partick](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/partick/). Trains from both major stations in the city centre (Glasgow Central and Glasgow Queen Street) pass through here. The station is around a 20 minute walk from the university, but it has an attached underground station (see below) which can be used to reduce walking time to 2-3 minutes. 

Tickets are best bought in advance. You can use the [ScotRail app](https://www.scotrail.co.uk/plan-your-journey/scotrail-app), or buy from a ticket machine or ticket office (note that not all stations have ticket offices, and ticket machines may be out of service at times). 

It is possible to buy tickets from the conductor on the train, but it's not recommended to rely on being able to do that. ScotRail also frequently check tickets of passengers debarking at busy stations, and major stations like Glasgow Central and Glasgow Queen Street have automated ticket gates. Buying a ticket before you board helps to avoid any delays. 

## Underground

Glasgow has a small underground network called the [Subway](https://www.spt.co.uk/travel-with-spt/subway/), consisting of a ring of stations served by trains running clockwise ("Outer Circle") and anti-clockwise ("Inner Circle"). See [here](https://www.spt.co.uk/travel-with-spt/subway/maps-stations/) for a diagrammatic view.

The closest station to the university is **Hillhead**, although both **Kelvinhall** and **Kelvinbridge** are relatively close too. 

Note that because the system is ring-shaped every train eventually passes through every station. Normally you will want to pick the "circle" that minimizes your travel time. For example, if you are boarding at Partick and want to go to Hillhead, this is only 2 stops along the Outer Circle but much longer on the Inner Circle. 

All stations have automated ticket gates. Tickets can be purchased from ticket machines or from ticket offices. Note that you must retain your ticket until the end of your journey, because you need to tap it on the ticket gates to exit a station! 

Ticket types are single, return, or all-day, and pricing can be viewed [here](https://www.spt.co.uk/tickets/subway-tickets/).

TODO

## Bike

The university has many bike parking locations on campus, and there is a city-wide bike hire scheme run by [Voi](https://www.voi.com/city/glasgow). 

Please be aware that many of the roads around the university can be very busy with vehicle traffic. If cycling from the city centre, TODO describe route following cycle lanes + kelvin way/kelvingrove park.

## On foot

Walking to the university campus from the city centre is easy to do and takes around 45 minutes.
