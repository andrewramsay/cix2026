*Keynote talk title:* Generative AI for Connection and Creativity

*Abstract:*  In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI models and tooling innovation, a central question guides our work: How do we build technologies that genuinely support people in pursuing what matters to them? This keynote lecture reflects on recent research from the People Centric AI area at Microsoft Research Cambridge, highlighting progress toward AI systems that understand human context, foster equitable access and representation, and act as generative “connective tissue” for collaboration and creativity. Through examples spanning world model research, inclusive data practices, and emerging tools that help people express ideas, explore possibilities, and work together more effectively, the talk outlines best practices for developing AI that amplifies human potential and strengthens the connections between us.
