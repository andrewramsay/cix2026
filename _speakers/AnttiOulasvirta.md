Antti Oulasvirta leads the Computational Behavior Lab (cbl.aalto.fi) at Aalto University and the Interactive AI research program at FCAI (Finnish Center for AI). Prior to joining Aalto, he was a Senior Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and the Cluster of Excellence on Multimodal Computing and Interaction at Saarland university. He received his doctorate in Cognitive Science from the University of Helsinki in 2006, after which he was a Fulbright Scholar at the School of Information in University of California-Berkeley in 2007-2008 and a Senior Researcher at Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT in 2008-2011. During his postgraduate studies in 2002-2003, he was an exchange student at UC Berkeley's Neuropsychology Lab. He was awarded the ERC Starting Grant (2015-2020) for research on computational design of user interfaces and the ERC Advanced Grant (2024-2029) for studying computational models of human behavior. Dr. Oulasvirta serves as an associate editor for ACM TOCHI and has previously served International Journal of Human-Computer Studies and IEEE Computer. He frequently participates in the paper committees of HCI conferences, including the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI). His work has been awarded the Best Paper Award and Best Paper Honorable Mention at CHI sixteen times between 2008 and 2025. He has held keynote talks at NordiCHI'14, CoDIT'14, EICS'16, IHCI'17, ICWE'19, Chinese CHI'19, and IS-EUD'23. He is a Fellow of ELLIS (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems).
