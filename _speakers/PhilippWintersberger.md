*Course title:* CR/RL-based Simulated Users with Unity and ML-Agents

*Abstract:* 3D game engines are well-suited to train cognitive user models in realistic and dynamic simulation environments. In this course, we will address the design of bounded internal environments for computationally rational cognitive models and discuss the pros and cons of different belief state approximations, such as discrete or continuous. Together, we will implement and train models of “distracted drivers” that overtake lead vehicles while occasionally interacting with a simulated in-vehicle infotainment system. The course offers hands-on C# and Python programming experience, enabling students to implement, train, and test constrained cognitive models directly in the Unity 3D game engine. 

*Biography:* Philipp Wintersberger is a Professor of Intelligent User Interfaces at IT:U, in Austria. He leads an interdisciplinary team of scientists working on research projects funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), and industry partners. His work focuses on human-machine cooperation in safety-critical environments, including automated vehicles, robotic and industrial systems, and AI-supported workplaces. Dr. Wintersberger has (co)authored numerous works published in major journals and conferences, such as ACM CHI, ACM IUI, AutomotiveUI, and Human Factors, and his contributions have earned several awards. He is a founding member of SIGCHI Austria and serves on the ACM AutomotiveUI steering committee.
