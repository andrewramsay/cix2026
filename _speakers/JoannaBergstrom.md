Joanna Bergström is an Associate Professor of Human–Computer Interaction at the University of Copenhagen. Her research investigates how people learn and adapt to the use of interaction techniques from mouse-based selection to new controllers of virtual bodies, drawing on motor-learning models of how the brain integrates and uses sensory information. She has developed conceptual models of user interfaces and haptics, predictive models of interactive task performance, and derived interaction techniques from formal models of human motor behavior. Her work aims to build foundational principles for more effective and adaptive interfaces.
