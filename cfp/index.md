**Call for student applications for the Summer School**

*The deadline for student applications is March 14, 2026, anywhere on Earth.*
(However, in the case of oversubscription we will prioritise early applications, so don't delay in sending your application.)

If you need a visa to enter the UK, please highlight this in your e-mail, giving details of your nationality and expected visa processing time at the start, and submit your application as early as possible. We will prioritise the early processing of such applications, and provide a letter to show the consular authorities, before the general deadline to help give you the time to sort out the visa.  

The student submission form will ask you to submit a CV, and a short research statement (no longer than 1 page) describing your research interests and a brief description of how attending this summer school will help you in your research.  Note that submitting an application is a binding registration, and upon acceptance you will need to pay the registration fee.

**Call for Workshops**

*Deadline 14th February 2026, anywhere on Earth*

We are interested in proposals for workshops. A CIX Workshop is a working session where people come together to share ideas, solve problems, and learn from each other about a focused topic in the general area of computational human-computer interaction.

Please send us a one page description to [cix2026+workshops@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:cix2026+workshops@glasgow.ac.uk). 
1. Why this workshop? 
Explain the topic, what's important about it, and your goals. Workshops will be attended by all Computational Interaction Symposium regular attendees. Explain why this topic will be of broad relevance. 
1. Who’s organizing? 
List names, roles, and why you are the right team. (Don't add names of people who are not planning to be there in person!)
1. Activities: 
What will you do in the workshop? (e.g., talks, hands-on demos)
1. After the workshop: 
What happens next? Will there be a report or follow-up? A journal special issue? A grant proposal?
1. Call for Participation (250 words): 
Provide a 250-word title and abstract that will be posted on CIX 2026 site to advertise your workshop to the CIX community. This should appear at the end of your workshop proposal and should include the following:
- Your format and goals
- If you are calling for contributions, who should contribute and what they need to submit, including how and when to submit
- Publishing plans (do you want to create a special issue of a journal?)
- That all of the named organizers agree to register by the early-bird deadline, and attend. 
- Workshop website, if appropriate.

Workshop proposals will be selected by the local Chairs and some other CIX Board members. One of the organisers should be prepared to make a contribution to the Field Building session to argue for the importance of the workshop.

**Call for Talks and Posters**

*Deadline 28th February 2026, anywhere on Earth*

We will have three main `open' presentation options:
- Long and short talk presentations (20 and 10 minutes).
- Opinion talks (5 minutes) as part of the `Field Building' session  on Wednesday morning.
- Posters.

*Talks*

If you would like to present a talk during the Symposium, please send us a title and abstract by the 28th February 2026. If you already have a pre-print or publication on the topic, please share the link to the paper as well. There will be no published paper associated with the Symposium, so this is primarily an opportunity to share the ideas with your peers. Please state whether you think the paper would ideally be presented as a *long* (20 minutes) or *short* (10 minutes) talk.

*Opinion Talks*

The Field Building session on Wednesday the 17th June will be a chance for us to take stock of developments in the field of *Computational Interaction* and raise questions and topics that you think the field needs to address. Give a Title and abstract of the point you would like to communicate. We anticipate that it should take no more than 5 minutes to make the point, and then the participants can discuss it for 5-20 minutes. 

*Posters*
We will have a poster session on the first day, before the Welcome Reception, and this will be a good chance for people to get to know each other, so all participants are welcome to present a poster. Please provide the poster title when registering, if you wish to present one, so that we can plan sufficient space. If you need a formal acceptance letter for travel funding purposes, please let us know, and we can generate one for you.

Send the details to   [cix2026+submissions@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:cix2026+submissions@glasgow.ac.uk).
