**Call for Workshops**
*Deadline 31st January 2026.*

We are interested in proposals for workshops. A CIX Workshop is a working session where people come together to share ideas, solve problems, and learn from each other about a focused topic in the general area of computational human-computer interaction.

Please send us a one page description to [cix2026+workshops@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:cix2026+workshops@glasgow.ac.uk). 
1. Why this workshop? 
Explain the topic, what’s important about it, and your goals.
1. Who’s organizing? 
List names, roles, and why you’re the right team.
1. Activities: 
What will you do in the workshop? (e.g., talks, hands-on demos)
1. After the workshop: 
What happens next? Will there be a report or follow-up?
1. Call for Participation (250 words): 
Provide a 250-word title and abstract that will be posted on CIX 2026 site to advertise your workshop to the CIX community. This should appear at the end of your workshop proposal and should include the following:
- Your format and goals
- Who should join and what they need to submit
- How to submit
- Publishing plans
- That at least one organizer per accepted workshop must attend
- Workshop website

Workshop proposals will be selected by the local Chairs and some other CIX Board members. 

**Call for Talks and Posters**
*Deadline 28th February 2026*

We will have three main `open' presentation options:
- Long and short talk presentations (20 and 10 minutes).
- Opinion talks (5 minutes) as part of the `Field Building' session  on Wednesday morning.
- Posters.

*Talks*

If you would like to present a talk during the Symposium, please send us a title and abstract by the 28th February 2026. If you already have a pre-print or publication on the topic, please share the link to the paper as well. There will be no published paper associated with the Symposium, so this is primarily an opportunity to share the ideas with your peers. Please state whether you think the paper would ideally be presented as a *long* (20 minutes) or *short* (10 minutes) talk.

*Opinion Talks*

The Field Building session on Wednesday the 17th June will be a chance for us to take stock of developments in the field of *Computational Interaction* and raise questions and topics that you think the field needs to address. Give a Title and abstract of the point you would like to communicate. We anticipate that it should take no more than 5 minutes to make the point, and then the participants can discuss it for 5-20 minutes. 

*Posters*
Send a poster (they should be in portrait format). We will have a poster session on the first day, before the Welcome Reception, and this will be a good chance for people to get to know eachother. Posters should be sent in pdf format. 

Send the details to   [cix2026+submissions@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:cix2026+submissions@glasgow.ac.uk).
