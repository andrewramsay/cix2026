## Student Accomodation

There will be availability for S3CIX particpants at Queen Margaret Residences, which offers modern single en-suite rooms in self-catered flats at a cost of £46.50 per room, per night, for a single, en-suite room. 

You can find more information and photos here: [Queen Margaret Residences](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/accommodation/visitorstouristsgroups/residences/queenmargaretresidences/).

Delegates can book accommodation for any number of nights between Monday 15 June 2026 and Saturday 20 June 2026. We have been assigned 40 rooms on a first-come-first served basis.  

The booking portal link is [https://book.accom.gla.ac.uk/KxBnBLive/Default.aspx](https://book.accom.gla.ac.uk/KxBnBLive/Default.aspx).

Please use promotion code **S3CIX25** so that you are allocated the right price and location. 

Accommodation bookings must be paid for online at the time of reservation, and this process is completely separate from the Symposium/Summer School Registration process. 

If the booking process is not completed with payment (by card) then the room is not reserved. Please book and pay for your accomodation before the **15th of April 2026**.
